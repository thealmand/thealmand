- 👋 Hi, I’m @thealmand
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about software engineering to see if it's something that might make for a more enjoyable career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. Have dabbled in the past with QBasic (ROFL), C++, HTML, and BASH. Want to learn more about SQL and NET(whatever that is).
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn more about what self guided resources there are out there and oppertunites that might allow me to get a feel for what it is like being a software engineer.
- 📫 How to reach me via email theaalmand@gmail.com
